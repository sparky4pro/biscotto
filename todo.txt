@bug 4
Function literals in group does not accept hash directives. Flags are now assigned to declaration not to function literal.

@bug 5
The auto cast is not properly evaluated in compile time. Evaluation is skipped because we do not have the type yet.

@bug 5
Direct access to type struct info members crashes the compiler.

expected_k_offset := outer_info.members[0].offset_bytes;

@compiler 5
Check mutability of member_ptr and addrof in general after recent changes.

@compiler 2
Introduce #nocomptime directive to mark functions which should never be executed in compile time?

@bug 2
This is not parsed properly: 'bar() catch;'

@compiler 4
Mixed functions are generated on each call, we need some caching based on passed comptime values.

@compiler 3
What about comptime call and catch block? We should probably disable them.

@compiler 3
Implement root type scope deduction based on context.
Mainly used for enums, so we don't have to type full enum name everytime, something like '.Struct'.

@docs 3
Add 'IS_COMPTIME' to docs?

@docs 2
Improve #comptime documentation?

@compiler 3
Implement comptime calls.

x :: my_scope.foo(10, 20) #comptime;
- Warn when function is already marked as comptime.
