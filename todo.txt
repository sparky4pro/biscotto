@bug 4
Function literals in group does not accept hash directives. Flags are now assigned to declaration not to function literal.

@bug 5
The auto cast is not properly evaluated in compile time. Evaluation is skipped because we do not have the type yet.

@bug 3
Intrinsic functions (lot of math stuff) cannot be directly called in compile time using #() call.


@bug 5
Direct access to type struct info members crashes the compiler.

expected_k_offset := outer_info.members[0].offset_bytes;

@compiler 4
Check mutability of member_ptr and addrof in general after recent changes.

@compiler 2
Can we generate default return for void returning functions in AST stage?

@compiler 4
Check is we cannot somehow reduce temp allocas.

For example on unroll generation, we create temp for comptime values which cannot be converted to
constants. Cannot we use LLVM const GEP instead if it's a thing?

@compiler 1
Allow #if with then and used as expressions.

@compiler 1
Add support for static #switch.

@compiler 2
Add support for struct initializers having pointer to parent declaration.

	FOO :: Foo.{ &FOO };

@compiler 2
Introduce #nocomptime directive to mark functions which should never be executed in compile time?

@bug 2
This is not parsed properly: 'bar() catch;'

@bug 3
Missing error report on:

	ptr += 1;

@bug 5
New comptime local value setup cause issues with setting struct members via pointer.

request :: Request.{ job_kind = JobKind.LSP };
rd :: &request.data.lsp;
rd.kind     = LspRequestKind.INITIALIZE;

@compiler 4
Mixed functions are generated on each call, we need some caching based on passed comptime values.


@bug 4
Volatile type propagation does not work in case of conditional breaks:

	if 1 == 1 {
		print("Hello!\n");
	}

$

@compiler 3
What about comptime call and catch block? We should probably disable them.

@compiler 3
Implement root type scope deduction based on context.
Mainly used for enums, so we don't have to type full enum name everytime, something like '.Struct'.

@docs 3
Add 'IS_COMPTIME' to docs?

@docs 2
Improve #comptime documentation?

@compiler 3
Implement comptime calls.

x :: my_scope.foo(10, 20) #comptime;
- Warn when function is already marked as comptime.

@bug 4
Enum type infer does not work in binary expressions?

if mode != .NONE {
}
